CA7 or arm32 specific:

system/linker:
	memory.ld
	- Update the addresses of mem regions

	stm32mp15xx_ca7.ld
	- Link script in general needs to be updated with regions

system/newlib:
	- recompile with -mcpu=cortex-a35 and neon/vfp...
	- Or just use -stdlib?

system/mmu_ca7.c:
	- Need a64 mmu 


system/startup_ca7.c:
	- We have startup_stm32mp23xx_a35.c in cmsis-device/mp2/Source/Templates/gcc
		- from boot, parking cores, setup NEON, BranchPred, MMU, Caches, IRQ Handler(?)
	- also have stm32mp2xx_a35_el1_pagetables.s (probably is for mp2-boot)
	- also have startup64_stm32mp2xx_a35_el1.s (probably is for mp2-boot)

system/system_stm32mp1xx.h:
	- Have it in cmsis-device/mp2/Source/Templates/

CMSIS device:
	- Have a35 and m33 and m0

M33:
- where does the vector table live?
- what is the diff between alias regions? (boot alias vs. alias)
