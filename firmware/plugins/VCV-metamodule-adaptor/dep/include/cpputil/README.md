### cpputil ###

A collection of utility and helpers in C++. Written for c++20, but most headers will work with c++17 or earlier.

Generally, these were written for embedded projects that lacked the standard library.

To use, add the `cpputil` directory to your build system, and then #include what you use. 
To use the lookup tables, you need to compile `math_tables.cc` as well.
