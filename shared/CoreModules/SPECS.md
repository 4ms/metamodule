------------

Names:
Set the name of each object in AI or Inkscape to the display name.
Example: “Scale CV” (without the quotes).

There are two text elements required. They both must *not* be converted to outlines (must be editable text):
 - Text object with the name “slug”. Text content should be a short identifier (e.g. “SMR” or “EnOsc”)
 - Text object with the name “modulename”. Content is full module name (“Spectral Multiband Resonator”)

--------------

Object Order:
The order of the components in the layer in the AI file is the order that they will be scrolled through on hardware 
Therefore, make sure the order makes sense to a user.
Generally, go from top-left to bottom-right, but with common-sense groupings applied.
For example, on something like the SMR's six channel sliders and buttons, either go through all buttons then all sliders,
or go button1-slider1-button2-slider2-etc. But don't go button-FreqKnob-slider1-button2-LFOCV-slider2.
