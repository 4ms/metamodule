## Graphics

These are the source svg files which get converted to PNG files to be used in the firmware and simulator.

All graphics in Rack/ have been created as original artwork by 4ms Company and/or Dan Green. To be compatible with existing Rack plugins, the same names as in the Rack component library are used (most of the time).
