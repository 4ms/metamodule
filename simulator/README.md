## MetaModule Simulator


The simulator runs on a host computer and simulates the screen and the audio
outputs. The pixels should be identical to the actual hardware's pixels.

The audio should be the same as in hardware (though, your sound card might be
AC-coupled, vs. the hardware is DC-coupled).

The following guides are available for the simulator with GUI:

- [Simulator Usage](../docs/simulator-usage.md)
- [Compiling the Simulator](../docs/simulator-building.md)
- [Using plugins with the Simulator](../docs/simulator-ext-plugins.md)

The project can also be built without a GUI, and run headless.

- [Headless simulator](README-headless.md)
