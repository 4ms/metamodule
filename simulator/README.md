## MetaModule Simulator

The simulator runs on a host computer and simulates the screen and the audio
outputs. The pixels should be identical to the actual hardware's pixels.

The audio should be the same as in hardware (though, your sound card might be AC-coupled, vs. the hardware is DC-coupled).

The following guides are available:

- [Compiling the Simulator](../docs/simulator-building.md)
